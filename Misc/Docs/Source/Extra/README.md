# Extra

Alongside `DataConfigCore` we have two other modules `DataConfigExtra` and `DataConfigEditorExtra`. It have self contained samples built on top of DataConfig framework.

Note that these are not intended to be integrated directly. You can take these as references to write your custom features.
